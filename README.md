# OthelloJS

This project was written for an artifical intelligence class to implement minimax and alpha beta pruning into the game of Othello.
Written in Javascript, HTML and CSS by Carter Brimeyer.

I implemented a REALLY simple html interface to make use of the game functions for testing the AI

The current board evaluation is altevaluateBoard(board, isPlayerTurn) which checks the score of the game plus the amount of tiles the current player can convert on their turn.

## Using the code

-Simply launch othello.html in a browser

-Click on the gold squares to play Othello. Green squares will appear to show you what artificial intelligence believes to be the best move. It is set to depth 4 by default
